#### Git Squashing - Simplified
This is a simple guide on how to rebase/squash your commits.

``user@Computer-Name:~$ git clone REPOSITORY_LINK``

After this navigate to your cloned repo:

``user@Computer-Name:~$ cd REPOSITORY_NAME``

Next, you rebase. Type in everything after the $:

``user@Computer-Name:~/Pokemon-Showdown$ git rebase -i HEAD~NUMBER``

The commits you want to rebase will be a number. Let's say you edited a file 3 times without it being merged. So, you would type in: git rebase -i HEAD~3. You will get something like this:

{% highlight text linenos=table %}
pick 82ab2d8 update index.html
pick 2371da3 update client.js
pick 73f5h24 update index.js

# Rebase 832da32..a38f4e3 onto a71a115
#
# Commands:
# p, pick = use commit
# r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit = use commit, but stop for ammending
# s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
{% endhighlight %}

The order of commits from top to bottom goes oldest to newest, respectively.

Let's say we wanted to put the newest two commits into the top (oldest) commit. We can do this by navigating with the arrow buttons and replacing pick with squash:

{% highlight text linenos=table %}
pick 82ab2d8 update index.html
squash 2371da3 update client.js
squash 73f5h24 update index.js

# Rebase 832da32..a38f4e3 onto a71a115
#
# Commands:
# p, pick = use commit
# r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit = use commit, but stop for ammending
# s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
{% endhighlight %}

After you've squashed what you want to, ctrl + x to exit. Press Y to save changes. When it asks you to rename, just click enter and continue with the default path. After that, type in:

``user@Computer-Name:~/Pokemon-Showdown$ git push --force``

You will get a weird spiel about git push, but at the bottom, you should see something like this:

{% highlight text linenos=table %}
Counting objects: 1, done.
Writing objects: 100% (1/1), 240 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 1 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To git@github.com:REPOLINK/PATH
+ d152d96...afa5b8e master -> master (forced update)
{% endhighlight %}
